                A singleplayer/local multiplayer game (up to 4 players) with bots (8 total burros) inspired by twin-stick shooters. I made this in 7 days as an entry to the first Bevy Engine game jam following the theme "Unfair Advantage." It was rated 2nd place out of 74 entries.

                Players choose to play as one of 8 different burro pi√±atas and then attempt to be the last burro standing in each level of the game. Burros can shoot candy in just the cardinal directions but are able to move independently from where they're aiming. When hit, burros will flash momentairly and be invulnurable to damage but will also be unable to shoot. Shot candies have a limited range before disappearing and burros have a cooldown period before being able to shoot again.

At the start of each round, one burro is chosen randomly to be upgraded to the Mechaburro. The Mechaburro shoots lasers which travel faster, have a much larger range and also experience a shorter cooldown between shots.

Rounds ends when only one burro remains or 5 seconds after all human players have lost. Points are based on order of elimination with the first eliminated getting 0 points and each burro after getting 1 more than the previously eliminiated burro. Points are accumulated across rounds and the burro with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

                An isometric-view, single-played action game about walking your pet(s) through a neighborhood. I made this game in Rust using the Bevy engine as a submission for the 2nd Rusty game jam. The theme of the jam was an image of a half-dog-half-chicken interpreted however you'd like. It was rated 2nd place out of 17 entries.

                I wanted to make a game where you try to get the highest score before time runs out. Points can be added or deducted by various actions you or your pets do. Each additional pet you're walking multiplies the number of points you get per yellow orb.

                There are three types of pets: Dogs, Chickens and ChickenDogs, which each have their own behaviors and interactions with the environment.

                The player can walk up to 4 pets at a time, each controlled by one of the "face buttons" on your controller or the keys IJKL on your keyboard. The leashes' color corresponds to the button pressed to control that pet. Players can hold down the button to keep a constant pull on the leash or tap the button to give the leash a yank to quickly pull a pet toward the player.

                Walking around the block you'll encounter neighbors, chipmunks and worms. Dogs love to be petted, but will try to chase down chipmunks. Chickens ignore the chipmunks, will eat worms and will annoy people. ChickenDogs will destroy anything they encounter.

                The player levels up after each 1000 points which affects how quickly you can move and how powerful your pets are. Try to keep track of your pets because if they wander too far you may lose them and get a Game Over!

                Quick ProTip for Beginners: don't pick up too many pets too fast because it can get overwhelming!

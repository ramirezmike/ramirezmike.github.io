                <p>A snake game in 3D, but you're the food! This was my first game made with the Bevy Engine.</p>
                <p>You play as a chipmunk-y thing whose goal is to collect enough orbs in each level to spawn the exit. While collecting, you'll have to avoid the snake which behaves like the classic snake game but also will chase you if you get too close to its mouth.</p>

                <p>A singleplayer/local multiplayer game (up to 4 players) with bots (8 total burros) inspired by twin-stick shooters. I made this in 7 days as an entry to the first Bevy Engine game jam following the theme "Unfair Advantage." It was rated 2nd place out of 74 entries.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Players choose to play as one of 8 different burro piñatas and then attempt to be the last burro standing in each level of the game. Burros can shoot candy in just the cardinal directions but are able to move independently from where they're aiming. When hit, burros will flash momentairly and be invulnurable to damage but will also be unable to shoot. Shot candies have a limited range before disappearing and burros have a cooldown period before being able to shoot again.</p>

                <p>At the start of each round, one burro is chosen randomly to be upgraded to the Mechaburro. The Mechaburro shoots lasers which travel faster, have a much larger range and also experience a shorter cooldown between shots.</p>

                <p>Rounds ends when only one burro remains or 5 seconds after all human players have lost. Points are based on order of elimination with the first eliminated getting 0 points and each burro after getting 1 more than the previously eliminiated burro. Points are accumulated across rounds and the burro with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.  </p>

                <p>An isometric-view, single-player action game about walking your pet(s) through a neighborhood. I made this game using the Bevy Engine in 7 days as a submission for the 2nd Rusty game jam. The theme of the jam was an image of a half-dog-half-chicken interpreted however you'd like. It was rated 2nd place out of 17 entries. </p>

                <p>The goal is to get the highest score before time runs out. Points can be added or deducted by various actions you or your pets do. Each additional pet you're walking multiplies the number of points you get per yellow orb.</p>

                <p>There are three types of pets: Dogs, Chickens and ChickenDogs, which each have their own behaviors and interactions with the environment. Quick ProTip for Beginners: don't pick up too many pets too fast because it can get overwhelming!</p>
